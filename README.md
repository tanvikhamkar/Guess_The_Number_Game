# Guess_The_Number_Game
I have created simple code to play number game with computer.

The computer will think of a random number from 1 to 10 as secret number. Then ask player to guess the number and store it as guess number.

Compare the guess number with the secret number.

If the player guesses the right number he wins, so print player wins and computer loses.

If the player guesses the wrong number, then he loses so print player loses and computer wins.
